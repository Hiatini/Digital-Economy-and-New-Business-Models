# Digital-Economy-and-New-Business-Models
#### Academic project
###### Introduction
In order to develop a business analytics approach, I need to work on a real-world situation.
###### Objectives
The project involves identifying a real-world business problem or opportunity and designing and
implementing an analysis plan to address it using at least one of the modelling methods studied in the course. You are free to choose any business problem or opportunity or public policy issue that you consider challenging and useful to address using business analytics.

The data that you use should be readily available and verifiable.
Some examples of business problems or opportunities. Develop a model to:
$ explain and predict sales
$ explain and predict salary
$ explain and predict churn, â€¦
