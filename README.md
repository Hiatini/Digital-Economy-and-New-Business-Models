# :pushpin: Academic Project in Digital Economy and New Business Models
##### Introduction
In order to develop a business analytics approach, I need to work on a real-world situation.
##### Objectives
The project involves identifying a real-world business problem or opportunity and designing and
implementing an analysis plan to address it using at least one of the modelling methods studied in the course. You are free to choose any business problem or opportunity or public policy issue that you consider challenging and useful to address using business analytics.

The data that you use should be readily available and verifiable.
Some examples of business problems or opportunities. Develop a model to:

* explain and predict sales
* explain and predict salary
* explain and predict churn, â€¦ 

##### Your data set
Your data set should be made of a minimum of 50 observations and contains both quantitative and qualitative variables. You can find or build data sets from many online sources. 

##### Presentation
You have to upload a zip file named name1-name2.zip with :
* your R project (data sets and script) file
* your ppt presentation will detail:
* aim of the project and data source
*  how your data have been cleaned and/or recoded
* descriptive statistics and/or graph on each variable
* methodology used: from classical regression (linear/logit) to GAM
* results and comparison of prediction accuracy
* conclusion
